# afl-fixture-ios

ios version of my android app for the AFL Fixture ..

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.goalump.aflfixture&hl=en_AU

I stopped maintaining the ios app after seeing no value in paying $150 to Apple to publish free apps.

I have recently updated the code with the 2020 AFL Fixture so if you want to publish it you have my blessing.
Please let me know so I can tell my iphone mates about it.

Cheers,
Sam
